# [Disable Windows 10 Logon Blur](https://chocolatey.org/packages/disable-logon-blur)

Starting with Windows 10 1903 the logon screen background wallpaper is blurred. This package removes this feature to keep it in line with previous version and un-blurs the background.

Requirements:

* Windows 10 1903 (currently) - only previous version this should have no effect;
* Administrator rights - this allows the registry entries to be updated and will fail without it;
