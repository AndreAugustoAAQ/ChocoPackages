## Features

This application provides an easy way to perform the most common configuration tasks on a YubiKey.

The current version can:

* Display the serial number and firmware version of a YubiKey.
* Configure YubiKey Slots. A YubiKey have two slots (short press and long press), which may both be configured for different functionality. 
This tool can configure a [Yubico OTP](https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/) credential, a static password, a challenge-response credential or an [OATH](https://developers.yubico.com/OATH/) HOTP credential in both of these slots.
* Swap the functionality between two configured YubiKey slots.
* Enable or disable the different USB connections (USB modes).
