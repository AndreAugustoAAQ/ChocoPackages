<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

        <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

        <summary>Jump.Location learns your behavior by keeping track of how long you spend in certain directories and favoring them over the ones you don't care about.</summary>
        <description>If you spend any time in a console you know that `cd` is by far the most common command that you issue. I'll open up a console to it's default location in `C:\Users\tkellogg` or `C:\Windows\system32` and then issue a `cd C:\work\MyProject`. `Set-JumpLocation` is a cmdlet lets you issue a `j my` to jump directly to `C:\work\MyProject`.

It learns your behavior by keeping track of how long you spend in certain directories and favoring them over the ones you don't care about. You don't have to use `Jump-Location` as a replacement for `cd`. Use `cd` to go local, and use `Set-JumpLocation` to jump further away.

`Jump-Location` is a PowerShell implementation of autojump.

**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
