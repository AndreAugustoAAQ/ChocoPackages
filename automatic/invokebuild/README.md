Invoke-Build is a build and test automation tool which invokes tasks defined in PowerShell v2.0+ scripts. It is similar to psake but arguably easier to use and more powerful. It is complete, bug free, well covered by tests.

In addition to basic task processing the engine supports

* Incremental tasks with effectively processed inputs and outputs.
* Persistent builds which can be resumed after interruptions.
* Parallel builds in separate workspaces with common stats.
* Batch invocation of tests composed as tasks.
* Ability to define new classes of tasks.

Invoke-Build v3.0.1+ is cross-platform with PowerShell v6.

Invoke-Build can be effectively used in VSCode and ISE.

Several PowerShell Team projects use Invoke-Build.
