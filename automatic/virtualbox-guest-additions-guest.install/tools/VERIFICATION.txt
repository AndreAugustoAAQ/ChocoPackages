VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

To verify the files using the project source:

1. Please go to the project source location (https://www.virtualbox.org/svn/vbox/trunk/src/VBox/HostDrivers/Support/Certificates/) and download the source files;
2. Use Get-FileHash -Path Trusted-OracleCorporationVirtualBox-05308b76ac2e15b29720fb4395f65f38.cer to get the file hash value from both the built file (from step 1 above) and the file from the package and compare them;

Alternatively you can download the module from the PowerShell Gallery ...

    Save-Module -Name virtualbox-guest-additions-guest.install -Path <PATH TO DOWNLOAD TO>

... and compare the files from the package against those in the installed module. Again use Get-FileHash -Path <FILE TO VERIFY> to retrieve those hash values.
