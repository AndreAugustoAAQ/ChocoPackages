The Yubico Authenticator is a graphical desktop tool and command line tool for generating Open AuTHentication (OATH) event-based HOTP and time-based TOTP one-time password codes, with the help of a YubiKey that protects the shared secrets. Similar to Google Authenticator but for your desktop. There is an equivalent Android version so you can take your codes with you between desktop and mobile.

Requires a capable Yubikey device.
