        <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
        <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
        <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->
        <id>sublimetext3</id>
        <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
        <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
        <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->
