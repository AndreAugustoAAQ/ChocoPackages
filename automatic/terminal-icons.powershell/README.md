# ![terminal-icons Logo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pauby/ChocoPackages@f8bf233/icons/terminal-icons.powershell.png "terminal-icons") [terminal-icons.powershell Chocolatey Package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/terminal-icons.powershell)

Terminal-Icons is a PowerShell module that adds file and folder icons when displaying items in the terminal. This relies on the custom fonts provided by [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

> You must be using one of the fonts provided by Nerd Fonts for this module to work as these fonts include tons of custom glyphs/icons that are referenced by their unicode number.

You can pass the following parameters:

* `/core`     - Installs the module in the AllUsers scope for PowerShell Core;
* `/desktop`  - Installs the module in the AllUsers scope for Windows PowerShell (ie. Desktop Edition);

You can pass both `/core` and `/desktop` parameters to install on both. If you pass no parameters then `/desktop` is assumed.

_**NOTE: This module requires a minimum of PowerShell v4.**_

**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
