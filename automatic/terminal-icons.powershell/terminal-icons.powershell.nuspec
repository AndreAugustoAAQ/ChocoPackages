This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

        <summary>A PowerShell module to show file and folder icons in the terminal.</summary>
        <description>Terminal-Icons is a PowerShell module that adds file and folder icons when displaying items in the terminal. This relies on the custom fonts provided by [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

&gt; You must be using one of the fonts provided by Nerd Fonts for this module to work as these fonts include tons of custom glyphs/icons that are referenced by their unicode number.

You can pass the following parameters:

* `/core`     - Installs the module in the AllUsers scope for PowerShell Core;
* `/desktop`  - Installs the module in the AllUsers scope for Windows PowerShell (ie. Desktop Edition);

You can pass both `/core` and `/desktop` parameters to install on both. If you pass no parameters then `/desktop` is assumed.

_**NOTE: This module requires a minimum of PowerShell v4.**_

**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
