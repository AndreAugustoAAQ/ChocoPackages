Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you can run Hugo from any directory. This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you donâ€™t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second. A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs.

**NOTE: Between version 0.51 and 0.71 the x86 version only installs v0.51 of Hugo (x64 version is fine). This is fixed from the version after 0.71 [here](https://github.com/pauby/ChocoPackages/issues/53) thanks to [mikee](https://github.com/mikeee).**
