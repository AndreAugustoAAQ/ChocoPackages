# [keepass-plugin-rulebuilder](https://chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-plugin-rulebuilder)

This is a plugin for the KeePass 2 password manager. With this plugin, you can use the KeePass database to keep track of all of the different requirements that websites have for account passwords, and easily generate new passwords according to those requirements.

The strongest passwords are randomly generated. However, some services unwisely place constraints on the passwords that you can use. A website may state that a password must be less than a certain length, or that it must contain certain types of characters, or that it must not contain certain other characters. To make matters worse, every website has different requirements, so changing passwords means reconfiguring your password generator every time.

The password generator in KeePass helps with these challenges, but it can still be difficult to configure it to exactly meet the requirements of each service while keeping passwords as strong as possible.

The purpose of this plugin is to make it easy to tell KeePass how to generate a password for each service, and to streamline the process of changing passwords.
