<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->

    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <description>AssaultCube Reloaded is a free and open source first person shooter based on the semi-popular AssaultCube, which was based on the Cube FPS. It is multi-platform and low on system and networking requirements (see below), allowing you to have fun playing even with a low-end computer and/or network connection. 
    
It is set in realistic looking environments with fast and fun gameplay. As we created our modification, gameplay improved, but some improvements were made in exchange for higher networking requirements.

NOTE: A shortcut called 'AC Reloaded' is created to allow you to easily run the program.

NOTE: If you get the error 'The program can't start because OpenAL32.dll is missing' when running please see %ProgramData%\chocolatey\lib\acr\tools\bin_win32\readme_OpenAL.txt for the solution. This is an application issue and not a package one.
