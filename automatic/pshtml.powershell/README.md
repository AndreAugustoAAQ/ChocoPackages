PSHTML allow people to write a HTML document(s) using PowerShell-like syntax, which makes building webpages easier, and less cumbersome for 'native' PowerSheller's.

PSHTML offers the flexibility of the PowerShell language, and allows to add logic in PowerShell directly in the HTML structure. This open the possibility to add loops, conditional statements, switches, functions, classes, calling external modules etc.. all that directly from the same editor.

PSHTML comes with template functionality which allows one to include parts of web pages that are identical throughout the web page Eg: footer, Header,Menu etc..

Using PSHTML, offers code completion and syntax highlighting from the the default PowerShell language. As PSHTML respects the W3C standards, any HTML errors, will be spotted immediately.

Since version 0.7.0 PSHTML supports the creation of charts.
