The YubiKey Personalization Tool is used to program the two configuration slots in your YubiKey. The tool:

* is valid with any YubiKey (except the Security Key)
* works on Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux operating systems
* provides a graphical user interface

Use the YubiKey Personalization Tool to program your YubiKey in the following modes:

* Yubico OTP
* OATH-HOTP
* Static password
* Challenge-response

You can also use the tool to check the type and firmware of a YubiKey, or to perform batch programming of a large number of YubiKeys.

In addition, you can use the extended settings to specify other settings, such as to disable fast triggering, which will prevent the accidental triggering of the nano-sized YubiKeys when only slot 1 is configured.
