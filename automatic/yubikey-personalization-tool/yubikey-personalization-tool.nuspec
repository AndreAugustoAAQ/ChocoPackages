    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>The YubiKey Personalization Tool is used to program the two configuration slots in your YubiKey.</summary>
    <description>The YubiKey Personalization Tool is used to program the two configuration slots in your YubiKey. The tool:

* is valid with any YubiKey (except the Security Key)
* works on Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux operating systems
* provides a graphical user interface

Use the YubiKey Personalization Tool to program your YubiKey in the following modes:

* Yubico OTP
* OATH-HOTP
* Static password
* Challenge-response

You can also use the tool to check the type and firmware of a YubiKey, or to perform batch programming of a large number of YubiKeys.

In addition, you can use the extended settings to specify other settings, such as to disable fast triggering, which will prevent the accidental triggering of the nano-sized YubiKeys when only slot 1 is configured.

**NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
